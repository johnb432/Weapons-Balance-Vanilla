This collection of mods aims to rebalance other mods.
This rebalancing balances items from the basegame:
[list]
[*] Weapon weight balancing
[*] Magazine weight balancing
[*] Magazine compatibility
[*] Name & description fixes
[*] and further changes
[/list]

Visit the [url=https://github.com/johnb432/Weapons-Balance-Vanilla]GitHub[/url] to get all the changed items.

This mod in particular is not actually ACE dependent. The dependency is there if ACE is used (as ACE overwrites some things otherwise).

Credit to all the various mod authors.
